Non-Primitive Data Structures

Non-primitive data structures are data structures that are used to store and organize multiple values of different or same data types. Unlike primitive data types (such as int, float, char), non-primitive data structures can store large amounts of data and represent complex relationships among data elements. They help in efficient data management, processing, and retrieval.

Non-primitive data structures are also known as composite or derived data structures.

Types of Non-Primitive Data Structures

Non-primitive data structures are mainly classified into two types:

1. Linear Data Structures

In linear data structures, elements are arranged in a sequential order, and each element is connected to its previous and next element. Data is processed in a linear manner.

Common types of linear data structures include:

Array: Stores elements in contiguous memory locations and allows fast access using an index.

Linked List: Stores elements in non-contiguous memory locations connected by pointers.

Stack: Follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, where insertion and deletion occur at one end.

Queue: Follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle, where insertion occurs at the rear and deletion at the front.

2. Non-Linear Data Structures

In non-linear data structures, elements are not arranged sequentially. These structures represent hierarchical or network relationships among data elements.

Common types of non-linear data structures include:

Tree: Represents data in a hierarchical form with parent-child relationships.

Graph: Represents data as a collection of nodes connected by edges, used to model networks.
